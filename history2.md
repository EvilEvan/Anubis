### **Job Card: Context for Next Agent**

#### **Summary of Work Completed:**
1.  **Project Plan Enhancement:** Reviewed the initial `Anubis.md` plan and created a more detailed, themed version named `AnubisContext.md`. The new plan is tailored for "FNK Vision" hardware and incorporates a "Star Wars" vibe.
2.  **Filesystem Reconnaissance:** Listed directory titles within `C:\Users\User\OneDrive\Documents`.
3.  **Workflow Rules Established:** Created `rules.md` with seven project-leading workflow rulesets.
4.  **Optimization Analysis:** Created `OptimizationAnalysis.md` comparing both plans and outlining a refactored implementation strategy.

#### **Final Status:**
- The project's planning and optimization analysis phases are complete.
- **Awaiting instructions to proceed with implementation.**

#### **Summary of Work Completed:**
1.  **Project Structure:** Created the optimized directory structure for `anubis-guardian` including the microservices folders (`camera-service`, `recording-service`, etc.) as defined in `OptimizationAnalysis.md`.
2.  **Camera Service Initialization:**
    - Navigated into `anubis-guardian/services/camera-service`.
    - Initialized a Node.js project (`npm init -y`).
    - Created the entry point file, `index.js`.
3.  **Initial Discovery Script:**
    - Implemented a parallel network scanner in `index.js` to discover open ports (554, 80, 8080, 8000) on the local network.
    - Added a placeholder `identifyCamera` function.
4.  **Initial Test:** Ran the script (`node index.js`) and confirmed it executes without errors, completing the network scan.

#### **Current Project Status:**
- The foundational directory structure is in place.
- The `camera-service` has been initialized and contains a working, albeit basic, network scanning script.
- No cameras are being positively identified yet, as expected.

#### **Next Steps & Objectives:**
- **Enhance Camera Identification:** Flesh out the `identifyCamera` function in `camera-service/index.js` to send actual RTSP/HTTP requests to probe open ports.
- **Install Dependencies:** Add an RTSP client library (e.g., `node-rtsp-stream` or a lightweight alternative) to the `camera-service` to facilitate camera communication.
- **Refine FNK Vision Logic:** Use the installed library to test the default FNK Vision RTSP URL (`rtsp://[IP]:[PORT]/user=admin_password=admin_channel=1_stream=0.sdp`) against discovered devices.

**Ready to enhance the scanner and bring the cameras online, Master.**
