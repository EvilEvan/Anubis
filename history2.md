# **Anubis Project History & Job Card**

## **Session Date: 2025-07-05 (Initial Planning)**

### **Agent: Gemini**

---

### **Job Card: Context for Next Agent**

#### **Summary of Work Completed:**
1.  **Project Plan Enhancement:** Reviewed the initial `Anubis.md` plan and created a more detailed, themed version named `AnubisContext.md`. The new plan is tailored for "FNK Vision" hardware and incorporates a "Star Wars" vibe.
2.  **Filesystem Reconnaissance:** Listed directory titles within `C:\Users\User\OneDrive\Documents`.
3.  **Workflow Rules Established:** Created `rules.md` with seven project-leading workflow rulesets.
4.  **Optimization Analysis:** Created `OptimizationAnalysis.md` comparing both plans and outlining a refactored implementation strategy.

#### **Final Status:**
- The project's planning and optimization analysis phases are complete.
- **Awaiting instructions to proceed with implementation.**

## **Session Date: 2025-07-05 (Implementation Start)**

### **Agent: Gemini**

### **Job Card: Context for Next Agent**

#### **Summary of Work Completed:**
1.  **Project Structure:** Created the optimized directory structure for `anubis-guardian` including the microservices folders (`camera-service`, `recording-service`, etc.) as defined in `OptimizationAnalysis.md`.
2.  **Camera Service Initialization:**
    - Navigated into `anubis-guardian/services/camera-service`.
    - Initialized a Node.js project (`npm init -y`).
    - Created the entry point file, `index.js`.
3.  **Initial Discovery Script:**
    - Implemented a parallel network scanner in `index.js` to discover open ports (554, 80, 8080, 8000) on the local network.
    - Added a placeholder `identifyCamera` function.
4.  **Initial Test:** Ran the script (`node index.js`) and confirmed it executes without errors, completing the network scan.

#### **Current Project Status:**
- The foundational directory structure is in place.
- The `camera-service` has been initialized and contains a working, albeit basic, network scanning script.
- No cameras are being positively identified yet, as expected.

#### **Next Steps & Objectives:**
- **Enhance Camera Identification:** Flesh out the `identifyCamera` function in `camera-service/index.js` to send actual RTSP/HTTP requests to probe open ports.
- **Install Dependencies:** Add an RTSP client library (e.g., `node-rtsp-stream` or a lightweight alternative) to the `camera-service` to facilitate camera communication.
- **Refine FNK Vision Logic:** Use the installed library to test the default FNK Vision RTSP URL (`rtsp://[IP]:[PORT]/user=admin_password=admin_channel=1_stream=0.sdp`) against discovered devices.

**Ready to enhance the scanner and bring the cameras online, Master.**

### **Job Card: Context for Next Agent**

#### **Summary of Work Completed:**
1.  **Dependency Installation:**
    - Added `axios` for HTTP requests
    - Added `node-rtsp-stream` for RTSP handling
    - Added `ffmpeg-static` for video processing capabilities
2.  **Enhanced Camera Discovery:**
    - Implemented actual RTSP protocol testing with FNK Vision-specific URL patterns
    - Added HTTP endpoint probing for web-based camera interfaces
    - Created robust error handling and timeout mechanisms
3.  **Multi-Network Support:**
    - Refactored network discovery to scan all available network interfaces
    - Added filtering for appropriate subnets (/24 or larger)
    - Implemented parallel scanning across all detected networks
4.  **User Experience Improvements:**
    - Added emoji-based console output for better readability
    - Incorporated Star Wars themed messages throughout the process
    - Enhanced error reporting with troubleshooting suggestions

#### **Current Project Status:**
- The `camera-service` now contains a fully functional network scanner with actual camera detection capabilities
- The system can identify both RTSP and HTTP-based camera interfaces
- Multiple FNK Vision RTSP URL patterns are supported
- The service is ready for integration with the recording and streaming services

#### **Next Steps & Objectives:**
- **Recording Service:** Begin implementation of the `recording-service` microservice
- **Streaming Interface:** Develop the web UI for viewing camera streams
- **Camera Management:** Create a configuration interface for managing discovered cameras
- **Hardware Acceleration:** Implement the GPU-accelerated streaming as outlined in `OptimizationAnalysis.md`

**"I've made a lot of special modifications myself." The camera discovery service is now fully operational, Master.**

**May the Force be with the next agent who continues this journey.**
