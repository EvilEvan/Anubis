### **Job Card: Context for Next Agent**

#### **Summary of Work Completed:**
1.  **Project Plan Enhancement:** Reviewed the initial `Anubis.md` plan and created a more detailed, themed version named `AnubisContext.md`. The new plan is tailored for "FNK Vision" hardware and incorporates a "Star Wars" vibe, focusing on private, simple, and reliable surveillance.
2.  **Filesystem Reconnaissance:** At the user's request, I listed the directory titles within `C:\Users\User\OneDrive\Documents` to assist with future HDD cleanup. This was a read-only operation to be mindful of disk space.
3.  **Workflow Rules Established:** Created `rules.md` containing seven project-leading workflow rulesets to optimize collaboration, maintain a tidy project folder, and ensure a structured development process.

#### **Current Project Status:**
- The primary planning phase is complete. The project blueprint is `AnubisContext.md`.
- The initial repository contains `Anubis.md` (original plan), `AnubisContext.md` (current plan), and `rules.md`.

#### **Next Steps & Objectives:**
- **Begin Implementation:** The next logical step is to start with **Phase 3: The Clone Wars (Implementation Plan)** from `AnubisContext.md`.
- **Core Infrastructure:** Start by setting up the core project structure as outlined in "Week 1-2: Core Infrastructure".
- **FNK Vision Integration:** Concurrently, it would be beneficial to perform deeper research or testing on the FNK Vision hardware to confirm RTSP stream URLs and any specific API behaviors.

**Awaiting your instructions to proceed, Master.**
